    Lollipop+ devices are not affected by this issue. -->

    <!-- Needed because Android adds extra padding to the FAB automatically for pre-Lollipop devices in order to make
    the elevation shadow appear correctly. In order to ensure pre-Lollipop and Lollipop+ devices appear the same, use 16dp
    here, and 0dp in regular dimens file.  This could be worked around by using useCompatPadding="true" in all the FABs, but
    that is only available in later support libraries, and applications using this library may not be using a newer
    version. -->
